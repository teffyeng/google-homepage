Hi I'm Teffy, and  I hope you have fun looking at my Google page, this is part of my curriculum from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)as a practice to improve my HTML and CSS skills, there's nothing fancy in it I like to keep things simple (ok I'm new in this D:), but if you have any comments or recomendations Ill be happy to hear from you :)
